INTRODUCTION
- This is a simple referral tracking system for a basic affiliate marketing program.

- The repo includes a simple php web application where you can update the number of successful referrals made by each of the members of your affiliate marketing program.

- As a plus, it also includes a python script that can autogenerate 'welcome messages' you can send to members of your program.
	Each message has personalized referral links.


REQUIREMENTS
- You should be able to set up a php web server and host it on the internet.

- You need to install python on your computer to autogenerate the 'welcome messages.'


REPO STRUCTURE
- The 'www' directory contains the php web application. It is customized for my specific use case.

- The 'generator' directory contains the python script to autogenerate the 'welcome messages.' Follow the instructions below to run the script successfully:
	- Replace the content of 'original.txt' with your desired message.
	- Insert [refid] anywhere you would want a specific id assignment statement inserted. For example, [refid] would get replaced with something like Refid134.
	- Insert [refnumber] anywhere you want a specific id inserted. For example, "Your membership id is [refnumber]" would get replaced with "Your membership id is 134".
	- Run the python script 'generator.py'. The script will prompt you for all required parameters. It's pretty intuitive.
	- All autogenerated messages are stored in 'generator/messages/'.
