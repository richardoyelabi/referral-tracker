Welcome aboard!
Geek Universe is a free WhatsApp channel for science and tech updates. We need you to help increase our reach to science and technology enthusiasts who may not have heard about us. We will be paying you US$10 for every 1000 people you successfully refer to our channel. This should be relatively easy as we have a ridiculously high conversion rate when the right audience is targeted. 

You can request for payment anytime as long as you have earned up to US$1.

Please note that everyone referred must speak and understand English as these are the only referrals that will be counted. Also, misleading individuals to join Geek Universe with intentions other than to get science and technology content (including but not limited to job offers) will not be tolerated and may lead to dismissal of conversion counts and/or contract termination. 

This is your referral link:
